    <h1>Sobre mim</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Jo√£o Victor and I'm 25 years old, I've always been interested in programming, but I never really got involved until I took a Python course on Udemy in 2023.
    Since then I have continued to take some courses on the platform, such as the HTML course I am using to create this website. </p>
    I have a degree in gastronomy from the Federal Institute of Santa Catarina - Campus Contineite (IFSC) and I currently work in the area as a cook and bartender.
