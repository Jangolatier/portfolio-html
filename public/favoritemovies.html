 <h1>João's favorite movies</h1>
<h2>Top 3 films of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Coherence (2013)</h3>
<p>It's one of my favorites because it's a film about Sci-fi themes that grow gradually without forcing things and it's very well acted.</p>
<h3>Matrix (1999)</h3>
<p>Simply a science fiction classic.</p>
<h3>Everything everywhere all at the same time (2022)</h3>
<p>Simply perfect</p>
